# sphinx-extensions


This repository for development on sphinx-extensions.

Video
======


Currently, development is focus on providing HTML5 compatible video to be able to embeded within Sphinx documentation without using the raw directive. 
The next step in development is to sync video files the same way the image directive allows for images to be included. 

Furthermore, the current inception of this project is only for HTML output.  This is also an area of further development.

Indexer
=======

This also contains a prototype indexer that searches through the file system to find .rst files and adds them to the index.
